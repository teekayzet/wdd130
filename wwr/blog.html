                <h1 class="home-title">Highlights from the past season</h1>
                <p>What an incredible season we have had. We celebrated our 50th year of running 
                    trips down the Grand Canyon. This year we ran 36 trips down the Grand Canyon 
                    introducing over 800 people to one of our favorite places on earth. We trained 
                    4 new guides and welcomed them to our family. The season started off with some 
                    chilly weather in the early season, but our guests braved the cold and loved 
                    every minute of their trip (show pictures). Later the temperatures soared 
                    reaching highs of 120 F in the Grand canyon and 95 on the Salmon. We didn't 
                    have any trouble getting people in the water at those temperatures.</p>

                <h2>Encounters in the wild!</h2>
                <p>Our trips are all run in some of the most remote areas of the United States. We share these areas with lots of critters both large and small. Here are some tips on what to do if you should find yourself face to face with one.</p>
                <p>They spend the day hiding and crawl out at night to hunt. They will eat crickets, moths, spiders and other insects. Many compare their sting to an intense bee sting. Relief can be found with ice, aspirin and time.</p>
                <p>When in the canyon, pay attention to where you are walking at night. Always wear your shoes or sandals. Always have a light with you to see where you are going. Never try to capture a scorpion and if you get stung, see your guide immediately.</p>
