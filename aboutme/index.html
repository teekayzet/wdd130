        I'm 22 years. I am a child of record and still aspiring to strengthen my faith and 
        testimonyin the Savior Jesus Christ. I am someone who is eager to learn, I love 
        technology and it is my drive, wanting to now more and be better and I enjoy finding
        ways to simplify life using it.</p>
    <p>
        I am persuing a degree in applied technology and i am currently working as a graphic designer.
        One thing I love the most about BYU-Idao is that it is a Spiritual environment where I not only
        enhance my education but also strengthen my testimony.</p>
